# weather-forcast

in this assignment i was required ti create a 5 day weather forcast usiung a server APi. This assignment wasnt as challenging as other assignments andi belive it is because we only added one new concept. The concpet was just simply calling an API once i called the api that data was stored in an array and it is my job to grab those items and make them display on the HTML. It was tedious but i got the hang of it rather quickly. I usedjquery as much as i could and looked at other peers and online code to incroporate concepts into my code. There are many useful resources on the internet that i used to my advantage. once i grabbed the text i wanted from the array i had to convert it into the standard system in the US which is mph, farenheit, etc. Overall this was a very useful assignmetn that i belive benefited me very much. I used fetch calls to grab the API response and used data as a paraemter to display those.
